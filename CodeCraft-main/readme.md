# Competitive Programming Handbook

Welcome to the **Competitive Programming Handbook Repository** — a comprehensive, structured, and community-driven collection of **algorithms, data structures, problem-solving techniques, and detailed explanations** aimed at helping students and developers master competitive programming.

This repository is designed to serve as a **single-source reference** for beginners as well as advanced programmers preparing for:

- Competitive Coding Contests  
- Technical Placement Interviews  
- Olympiads  
- GATE  
- ICPC  
- Codeforces  
- LeetCode  
- AtCoder  

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this project is to:

- Build a **complete handbook of competitive programming**
- Provide **clear explanations with clean implementations**
- Cover **all major algorithms and data structures**
- Include **common CP patterns and optimization tricks**
- Encourage **open-source collaboration**
- Maintain **professional documentation and structure**

This repository is meant to grow continuously with contributions from the community.

## Repository Structure


### `/algos`

This directory will contain:

- All **algorithms**
- Core **data structures**
- Classical **problem solutions**
- Optimized solutions
- Step-by-step explanations

Each algorithm must be placed in its **relevant category folder**, such as:

- `dp`
- `graphs`
- `trees`
- `math`
- `strings`
- `bit-manipulation`
- `greedy`
- `searching`
- `range-queries`

More directories will be added as the project scales.

## What This Handbook Will Contain

- Basic to Advanced Algorithms  
- Fundamental & Advanced Data Structures  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Graph Theory (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST, etc.)  
- Number Theory  
- Greedy Techniques  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Binary Search  
- String Algorithms (KMP, Z, Trie, Hashing)  
- Geometry  
- Range Queries (Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree)  
- Advanced Topics (HLD, Mo’s Algorithm, etc.)

Each topic will include:

- Algorithm explanation  
- Time & Space Complexity  
- Clean, readable implementation  
- Sample test cases  
- Optimization notes  


## How to Participate & Contribute

Contributions are **open to everyone**.
